# Investigating-Detective-Novels
This was a group project done for the STA130 course in Fall 2021. Group members were Aidan Li, Youssef Soliman, Min Gi Kwon, and Sarah Xu.

We have received explicit permission from the course coordinators to upload our code and final output to GitHub. 
The raw data file that our project uses is not ours, and was provided by the university. 
We did not receive permission from the original authors to upload it, and therefore, the raw data has not been uploaded to respect their privacy.

In this project, we were helping Professors Adam Hammond (English) and Simon Stern (Law) on their project, "The Birth of the Modern Detective Story". We were given a sample of 352 detective novels from the early 1800s to the early 1900s, and we performed statistical analyses on these to explore what makes a detective story enjoyable.

project-template-final.pdf is the presentation slide deck of our analyses made with R Markdown.

project-template-final.Rmd is the R code for the slide deck and also contains the code used for our computations and analyses.

detective_data.csv and calculated_detective_data.csv are raw and processed datasets respectively. They are not included in this repo because we did not receive permission from the original authors to upload the raw data and its derivatives.
